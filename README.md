# Road_Lane_Detection
#### The Road Lane Detection using OpenCV and Python.
We provide a strategy for detecting information about lanes and cars for the driver assistance system. Earlier studies could only detect individual lanes or cars. The combination of lane information and vehicle information, can help the driver aid system or lane change assistant system work more reliably. The frontal lanes must be detected and the cars around a test vehicle must be discovered for the lane change assistant system (LCAS).
As a result, in this investigation, a vision system with three cameras is used, two of which are mounted beneath the right and left-wing mirrors, while the other is mounted on the test vehicle's windscreen. Three lanes and cars are detected using the footage from the cameras.

# Algorithms Used:

### HOUGH TRANSFORMATION

The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing. The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure. This voting procedure is carried out in a parameter space, from which object candidates are obtained as local maxima in a so-called accumulator space that is explicitly constructed by the algorithm for computing the Hough transform.

### CANNY EDGE DETECTION
Canny Edge Detection is a popular edge detection algorithm. It is a multi-stage algorithm and we will go through each stages. Noise Reduction. Since edge detection is susceptible to noise in the image, the first step is to remove the noise in the image with a 5x5 Gaussian filter. 

### GAUSSIAN BLUR
In image processing, a Gaussian blur is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination.
Gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scales
